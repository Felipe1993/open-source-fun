# Open Source Fun
Welcome traveller! In this repository you can find useles changes that I've made in a open source projects, that for obvious reasons won't ever be merged to upstream project. 
You may ask: Why don't you keep sources in this repo, only diffs?
Good question. Ultimately this repo's purpose is to keep in one place diffs for many os projects. Why no submodules? Dunno.
